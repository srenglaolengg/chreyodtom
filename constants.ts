// FIX: The 'Schedule' type is no longer defined in './types' and was unused.
// This line has been removed to fix the compilation error.

// The ADMIN_U_IDS constant has been removed. User roles are now managed
// in the 'user_roles' table in the Supabase database.
// Data for Gallery, Teachings, and Events has been migrated to Firestore
// to be managed by the Admin Dashboard.
